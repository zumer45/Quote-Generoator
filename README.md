Simple Random Quote Generator

This is a simple random quote generator built with JavaScript that fetches quotes from a JSON API and displays them on the page. Users can generate a new quote by clicking the "New Quote" button and can tweet the current quote and author by clicking the "Twitter" button. In this example, we are using the Jacinto Design Quotes API.
